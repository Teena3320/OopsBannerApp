# OopsBannerApp

## UC1 - PrintOOPS
Display the literal text OOPS on the console.

## UC2 - PrintOOPS
Transform the simple console message into a multi-line banner using spaces and * characters.

## UC3 - PrintOOPS
Refactor the banner creation logic to be more memory‑efficient and maintainable using String.join() for cleaner, modular line construction.

## UC4 - PrintOOPS
Refactor the banner creation logic by storing all banner lines in a String array, printed using a loop instead of multiple print statements.

## UC5 - PrintOOPS
Make the banner creation more concise by declaring and initializing the String array in one line.

## UC6 - PrintOOPS
Break down the banner creation logic into reusable static methods, each responsible for generating the pattern for a single character like Static helper methods (e.g., getOPattern(), getPPattern(), getSPattern()).

## UC7 - PrintOOPS
Introduce a dedicated class to hold both a character and its banner pattern, providing a centralized and organized way to manage letter patterns using Encapsulation of pattern data and retrieval through getter methods.

## UC8 - PrintOOPS
Replace manual object lookup and linear searches with a Map‑based pattern lookup system, enabling fast and scalable retrieval of character patterns.
